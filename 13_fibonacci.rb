# nthFibonacci

# A Fibonacci sequence is a list of numbers that begins with 0 and 1, and each
# subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

# For example, the first seven Fibonacci numbers are: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8

# Write a method that will return the nth number of the sequence.

# The syntax is easy, getting your head around the algorithm is the challenge.
# Write the sequence on a piece of paper first and think about the steps
# you take for each number. Translate this to pseudocode and then to ruby.

#return index at nth number

# Difficulty:
# 6/10

# Example:
# nthFibonacci(0) -> 0
# nthFibonacci(3) -> 2
# nthFibonacci(6) -> 8

# Check your solution by running the tests:
# ruby tests/13_fibonacci_test.rb
